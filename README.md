# Loot Tracker

## Application to keep track of loot while shopping

The idea behind this application was to edit, display and remove collectable items
once they have been purchased from retail vendors. This application keeps track of
all items that have been added and gives authors the ability to:

- Add and edit new locations where collectables are located for purchase.
- Group multiple loot items in one location with prices listed.
- Add new price updates with updated date.
- Multiple categories of loot items (Movies, Video Games, etc.)
- See the fluctuation of price of item over extended period of time.
- Mark an item as purchased, effectively archiving it to a "display shelf" of collectables.
